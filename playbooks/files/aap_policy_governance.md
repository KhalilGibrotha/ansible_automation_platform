# Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Governance & Configuration Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
- Define AAP governance, organizations, role-based access control (RBAC), and permissions.
- Ensure secure, scalable, and standardized automation practices for {{ ORGANIZATION_NAME }}.

### 1.2 Scope
- Covers user access, job execution, inventory management, and compliance policies.
- Excludes custom playbook development (handled by individual teams).

### 1.3 Audience
- **Platform Engineers & Administrators**: Maintain platform governance.
- **Engineers & Operators**: Execute and develop automation.
- **Security & Compliance Teams**: Audit platform usage.

---

## 2. AAP Architecture & Execution Model
### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
- AAP consists of Control Nodes (Orchestration) and Execution Nodes (Playbook Execution).
- Execution Environments (EEs) run in user space on Execution Nodes for security.

### 2.2 Control Plane vs. Execution Plane
- **Control Nodes**: AAP Web UI, API, RBAC Management, Job Scheduling.
- **Execution Nodes**: Run jobs inside isolated containers, fetch EEs from {{ AAP_REGISTRY_URL }}.

### 2.3 Security & Isolation
- RBAC controls all job executions and inventory modifications.
- Only Execution Nodes run playbooks, preventing privilege escalation risks.
- Centralized inventory and credential management to avoid unauthorized system modifications.

---

## 3. AAP Organizations & Role-Based Access Model
### 3.1 Organization Structure
- **Prod**: Hosts approved automation for production environments.
- **Develop**: Used for testing and validating playbooks before production deployment.

#### Why This Model?
- **Simplicity & Scalability**: Avoids redundant team-based orgs.
- **Code & Automation Parity**: Matches Dev → Prod branching strategy.
- **Transparency**: All roles have read access to both organizations.

### 3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Model
- No individual user permissions → Access granted only via team roles.
- **RBAC Provider**: {{ AAP_RBAC_PROVIDER }}
- **Identity Management System**: {{ IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM }}
- Platform Engineers govern inventories & job templates, preventing license overuse.

### 3.3 Team Role Definitions
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------|
| **Platform Administrator** | Full control over AAP resources. |
| **Platform Architecture** | Admin in Develop, Read-only in Prod. |
| **Platform Engineer** | Develops & maintains automation workflows. |
| **Platform Operator** | Executes approved automation workflows. |
| **Platform Auditor** | Read-only access for compliance monitoring. |

### 3.4 Permissions Model Overview
- **Inventories**: Centrally managed by Platform Admins, preventing license overuse.
- **Job Templates**: Created by Platform Engineers; Operators can execute but not modify.
- **Credentials**: Stored in {{ AAP_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE }} with RBAC restrictions.

## 4. Platform Configuration
### 4.1 Load Balancer Integration
- Load Balancer: {{ AAP_LOAD_BALANCER }}
- Health checks & failover policies.

### 4.2 Authentication & Access Control
- LDAP/Okta Authentication integration.
- RBAC enforcement via {{ IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM }}.
- SailPoint integration for user lifecycle management.

### 4.3 Execution Environment Configuration
- Standardized Execution Environment (EE) image lifecycle.
- Secure EE hosting in {{ AAP_REGISTRY_URL }}.
- Building & Updating EEs using Ansible Builder.

### 4.4 Collections Management
- Approved collections whitelist & versioning policies.
- Architectural review process for new collections.
- Automating collection updates via {{ AAP_REGISTRY_URL }}.

### 4.5 Host Inventory & Groups
- Centralized inventory management by Platform Engineers.
- RBAC-driven inventory access control.
- Preventing overutilization of licensed hosts in {{ AAP_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT }}.

---

## 5. Team Onboarding & Role Integration
- AAP organization structure and its rationale.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) policies and team roles.
- How permissions are granted and policy against individual user permissions.

### 5.1 AAP Team Roles & Permissions
- **No Individual Permissions**: Access is assigned only through team roles mapped to {{ AAP_RBAC_PROVIDER }}.
- **SailPoint Integration**: Team membership is managed through SailPoint to ensure identity governance.
- **Platform Engineers Manage Resource Assignments**: Assign inventories, job templates, and projects to team roles, but group membership is handled via {{ IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM }}.
- **Transparent Access**: All roles have read access to both organizations to enable cross-team collaboration.

## 6. Security & Compliance
### 6.1 Hardening Guidelines
- User-space only container execution on Execution Nodes.
- RBAC & network segmentation for security isolation.

### 6.2 Sensitive Data Management
- All API keys & credentials stored in {{ AAP_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE }}.
- No hardcoded secrets in playbooks.
- Platform Admins manage all secrets.

### 6.3 Compliance Monitoring & Auditing
- Compliance audits conducted {{ AAP_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_FREQUENCY }}.
- Weekly security log reviews in Splunk.
- Automated compliance reporting via Ansible.

---

## 7. Enhancements & Continuous Improvement
### 7.1 Roadmap for Enhancements
- New integrations: ServiceNow, SIEM, Cloud APIs.
- Automating governance policies (e.g., Role assignment automation).

### 7.2 Retrospective Processes
- Quarterly usage & access reviews.
- Team feedback sessions & automation improvements.
